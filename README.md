# Cats-vs-Dogs
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

Note- Don't unzip the folders as the code for that is already in the notebook.

The train1.zip folder contains 25k images. 
The test1.zip folder contains 12500 images of cats and dogs for prediction. Using this is not compulsory. I have used this to show how you can make predictions on multiple images in a folder and save to a csv file.

The notebook was executed in google colab. So, if you are using google colab then save the zip files in your drive and then click on "Mount Drive" in google colab.
